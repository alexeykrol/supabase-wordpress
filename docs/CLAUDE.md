# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: See AGENTS.md instead

**This file has been replaced by a new documentation structure**

---

## üîÑ Migration Notice

The old `CLAUDE.md` format has been replaced with a universal AI agent documentation structure compatible with all AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

### New Documentation Structure

Please refer to these files instead:

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** - AI agent instructions (replaces this file)
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and design decisions
- **[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)** - Implementation status and roadmap (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- **[README.md](README.md)** - User-facing project documentation
- **[FLOW.md](FLOW.md)** - Authentication flow visualization (Mermaid diagram)

## üìå Quick Migration Guide

| Old File | New File | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md (this file) | **AGENTS.md** | AI assistant instructions |
| N/A | **ARCHITECTURE.md** | Technical architecture |
| N/A | **BACKLOG.md** | Roadmap and status |
| README.md | **README.md** | User documentation (updated) |
| FLOW.md | **FLOW.md** | Flow diagrams |

## üéØ For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant reading this file, please:

1. **Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** first - Contains all working instructions
2. **Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Understand the technical design
3. **Review [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)** - See current status and planned features
4. **Reference [README.md](README.md)** - User-facing documentation

**Do not use this file for development guidance** - it is deprecated and kept only for historical reference.

## üöÄ Why the Change?

### Benefits of New Structure

1. **Universal Compatibility:** Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and other AI assistants
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Architecture, backlog, and workflow are now separate files
3. **Better Discoverability:** Each file has a clear, specific purpose
4. **Industry Standard:** Follows de-facto best practices for AI-assisted development

### Project Context

This is **Supabase Bridge for WordPress**, not the ChatOpenAI Integration project that the original CLAUDE.md was written for. The old content was completely irrelevant to this project.

---

## üìù Version History

- **2025-10-01:** Deprecated CLAUDE.md, migrated to AGENTS.md + ARCHITECTURE.md + BACKLOG.md structure
- Previous content was from a different project (ChatOpenAI Integration) and has been removed

---

**Please use [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for all AI-assisted development tasks.**
